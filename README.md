#BARS
BARS is an app that gives users a place to curate their own playlists of songs found using the YouTube API.

##Explore New Music
The "Home" page shows a list of the top 10 videos in YouTube's "Music" category.

##Playlists
The "Playlists" page contains the names of all of the user's playlists with the option to delete each playlist. When a playlist title is clicked, the user will see a list of songs that were added to the playlist. Each song has the option to be removed from the playlist. The user also has the ability to rename or delete the playlist from this page, as well.

##Search
The "Search" page gives the user the ability to search for music found on YouTube. The search results will prioritize videos that are found in the "Music" category of YouTube. Once a search is made, the user can add any of the results to one of their playlists.

##User Specific Data
BARS only shows playlists that were made by the current user, and these playlists cannot be edited or deleted by any other user.
